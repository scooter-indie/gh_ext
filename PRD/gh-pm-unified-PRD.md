# Product Requirements Document: gh-pm-unified

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Author:** scooter-indie
**Status:** Draft | Ready for Backlog Creation

---

## Product Vision

### Vision Statement
Create a unified GitHub CLI extension that combines project management, sub-issue hierarchy, and project templating into a single, cohesive tool for comprehensive GitHub Projects v2 management from the command line.

### Target Users
- **CLI-first developers** who prefer command-line workflows over web UI
- **Project managers** who need batch operations and automation
- **DevOps engineers** who integrate project management into CI/CD pipelines
- **Open source maintainers** managing issues across multiple repositories

### Key Value Proposition
Eliminate the need for multiple fragmented extensions (`gh-pm`, `gh-sub-issue`) by providing a unified tool with consistent command patterns, shared configuration, and new project templating capabilities not available in core `gh` CLI.

---

## Feature Areas (Future Epics)

### Epic 1: Core Unification
**Description:** Merge functionality from gh-pm and gh-sub-issue into a unified extension with consistent command structure.

**Capabilities:**
- Initialize project configuration (`gh pm init`)
- List issues in project with project metadata (`gh pm list`)
- View issue with project fields (`gh pm view`)
- Create issue with project fields pre-populated (`gh pm create`)
- Move/update issue status and priority (`gh pm move`)
- Find and add untracked issues to project (`gh pm intake`)
- Bulk process issues with configurable rules (`gh pm triage`)
- Add existing issue as sub-issue (`gh pm sub add`)
- Create new sub-issue under parent (`gh pm sub create`)
- List sub-issues of a parent issue (`gh pm sub list`)
- Remove/unlink sub-issue from parent (`gh pm sub remove`)
- Split issue into sub-issues from checklist or arguments (`gh pm split`)

**Success Criteria:**
- All commands from both source extensions work in unified tool
- Single `.gh-pm.yml` configuration file serves all commands
- Consistent flag patterns across all commands
- Backward-compatible with existing gh-pm configurations

### Epic 2: Project Templates & Creation
**Description:** Enable declarative project creation from YAML templates and existing GitHub projects.

**Capabilities:**
- Create project by copying existing GitHub project structure (`gh pm project create --from-project`)
- Create project from YAML template definition (`gh pm project create --from-template`)
- Export existing project structure to YAML template (`gh pm project export`)
- Validate template YAML syntax and schema (`gh pm template validate`)
- List available templates (built-in and local) (`gh pm template list`)
- Show template details and preview (`gh pm template show`)
- Initialize with template selection (`gh pm init --from-template`)
- Support Go template variables in templates (`{{.ProjectName}}`, `{{.Owner}}`, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can create consistent project structures from reusable templates
- Templates support all GitHub Projects v2 field types
- Template validation catches errors before project creation
- Built-in templates cover common workflows (Kanban, Scrum, Bug Tracker)

### Epic 3: Enhanced Integration
**Description:** Deep integration between sub-issues and project management features.

**Capabilities:**
- Native sub-issue handling in split command (remove external dependency)
- Cross-repository sub-issue support
- Progress tracking showing sub-issue completion percentages
- Recursive operations on full issue trees (bulk status updates, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- Split command works without gh-sub-issue installed
- Sub-issues can be created across different repositories
- Parent issues show accurate completion status
- Bulk operations respect issue hierarchies

### Epic 4: Template Ecosystem
**Description:** Build a template sharing and discovery ecosystem.

**Capabilities:**
- Remote template registry for community templates
- Template inheritance (templates extending other templates)
- Template versioning and schema migration
- Template discovery and search

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can discover and use community templates
- Template authors can publish and version templates
- Breaking schema changes handled gracefully

## Non-Functional Expectations

| Category | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Performance | Commands complete within 2-3 seconds for typical operations |
| Security | Respect GitHub token scopes; never store tokens in config files |
| Usability | Consistent with `gh` CLI conventions; helpful error messages |
| Compatibility | Support Go 1.21+; work with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise |
| Extensibility | Clean package structure enabling future capability additions |

---

## Constraints

- **GitHub API Limitations:** Sub-issues require special GraphQL headers (`sub_issues`, `issue_types`)
- **Workflow API:** GitHub Project workflows may not be fully creatable via API (needs verification)
- **License Compliance:** Must maintain MIT license and proper attribution to source projects
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing `.gh-pm.yml` files must continue to work

---

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Go | Consistent with gh CLI, source projects, and extension ecosystem |
| CLI Framework | Cobra | Industry standard, used by gh CLI and source projects |
| Configuration | Viper + YAML | Flexible parsing, environment variable support |
| Templating | Go text/template | Built-in, no external dependencies |
| API Client | go-gh | Official gh extension library with auth handling |

---

## Testing Approach

| Approach | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| TDD | Required | All business logic test-driven |
| ATDD | [ ] Used / [x] Not Used | CLI testing via integration tests |
| BDD | [ ] Used / [x] Not Used | Not applicable for CLI tool |

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all `pkg/` packages (config, template, API clients)
- Integration tests for commands using mock GitHub API
- End-to-end tests against test GitHub projects (optional, CI only)

## Dependencies

### Source Projects (MIT Licensed)
- [gh-pm](https://github.com/yahsan2/gh-pm) by @yahsan2
- [gh-sub-issue](https://github.com/yahsan2/gh-sub-issue) by @yahsan2

### Go Dependencies
- `github.com/cli/go-gh` - Official gh extension library
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - CLI framework
- `github.com/spf13/viper` - Configuration management

## Open Questions (Require Resolution)

| # | Question | Impact | Decision Needed By |
|---|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Final extension name? | Branding, installation command | Sprint 1 |
| 2 | Collaborate with original author or independent fork? | Community, maintenance | Sprint 1 |
| 3 | How long to maintain backward compatibility aliases? | Migration path complexity | Sprint 2 |
| 4 | Can GitHub Project workflows be fully created via API? | Template feature scope | Sprint 2 |
| 5 | Should there be a central template registry? | Epic 4 scope | Sprint 3+ |

## Notes for Backlog Creation

- Feature Areas → Epics
- Capabilities → User Stories
- Success Criteria → Acceptance Criteria
- Constraints → Considered during Sprint Planning
- Open Questions → May block certain stories until resolved

**Suggested Sprint Structure:**
- **Sprint 1:** Core unification (Epic 1) - establish foundation
- **Sprint 2:** Project templates basic (Epic 2 partial) - create from template
- **Sprint 3:** Project templates complete (Epic 2) - export, validation, built-ins
- **Sprint 4:** Enhanced integration (Epic 3)
- **Future:** Template ecosystem (Epic 4)
