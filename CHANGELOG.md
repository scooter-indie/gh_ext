## Sprint Summary

| Sprint | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Sprint 1 | Foundation, init, list | Complete |
| Sprint 2 | view, create, move, sub-issues | Complete |
| Sprint 3 | intake, triage, split | Complete |
| Sprint 4 | Epic 2 (Templates) | Removed - API limitations |
| Sprint 5 | Enhanced Integration | Complete |
| Sprint 6 | Test Coverage | Complete (63.6%) |

## API Limitations Discovered

### GitHub Projects V2 API
- **No `createProjectV2View` mutation** - Views cannot be created programmatically
- **Status field reserved** - New projects have a default Status field that cannot be replaced
- **Workflows not accessible** - Project automation workflows cannot be read or written via API

These limitations led to removing Epic 2 (Project Templates) from scope.
