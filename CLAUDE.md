# Claude Code - Project Instructions

**Purpose:** Automatic initialization with IDPF Framework integration
**Process Framework:** IDPF-Agile
**Domain Specialists:** Backend-Specialist, API-Integration-Specialist, PRD-Analyst

---

## Framework Configuration

This project uses the IDPF Framework ecosystem.
**Configuration:** See `framework-config.json` for framework location and project type.

---

## Startup Procedure

When starting a new session in this repository, **IMMEDIATELY** perform these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Date

State the date from your environment information and ask the user to confirm:

```
"According to my environment information, today's date is YYYY-MM-DD. Is this correct?"
```

If incorrect, prompt for the correct date. This prevents date-related errors in commits and documentation.

### Step 2: Load Configuration

Read `framework-config.json` to get the `frameworkPath`.

### Step 3: Load Startup Instructions

Read `STARTUP.md` - this contains condensed essential rules and guidelines.

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Integration (if needed)

If `.gh-pm.yml` does not exist, ask user if they have a GitHub repo and project.
If yes, run `gh pm init`. If no, skip.

If `.claude/commands/gh-workflow.md` has unreplaced placeholders, prompt user for values.

### Step 5: Confirm Ready

Confirm initialization is complete and ask the user what they would like to work on.

**Do NOT proceed with any other work until the startup sequence is complete.**

## Expansion Commands

Use these to load full documentation when needed:
- `/expand-rules` - Load complete Anti-Hallucination Rules
- `/expand-framework` - Load full process framework documentation
- `/expand-domain` - Load full Domain Specialist instructions

### Startup Notification

After completing the startup procedure, inform the user:

```
Expansion commands available: /expand-rules, /expand-framework, /expand-domain
Use these to load full documentation when needed.
```

### When to Suggest Expansion Commands

**Proactively suggest `/expand-rules` when:**
- User asks about code quality or best practices
- Reviewing code for potential issues
- User mentions concerns about accuracy or hallucination

**Proactively suggest `/expand-framework` when:**
- Starting TDD development cycles
- User asks about the development process
- Transitioning between framework phases

**Proactively suggest `/expand-domain` when:**
- Working on domain-specific tasks (backend, frontend, DevOps, etc.)
- User needs specialized technical guidance
- Implementing complex features in a specific domain
